# **Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment**





### About this project



This project looks at how traders behave when the crypto market is in Fear or Greed. I used real trading data along with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to see how trading volume and profit change with market mood.

The main idea is to understand whether traders perform better when the market is fearful or when it is greedy.



#### What I did



I cleaned both datasets and merged them using the date. Then I converted the trade data into daily summaries like total volume, total profit or loss, and number of trades. After that, I compared these values across different market sentiments and created a few charts to visualize the results.



#### Main findings



Traders are more active and more profitable during Fear and Extreme Fear periods. During Greed and Extreme Greed, both activity and profit are lower. This suggests that better opportunities often appear when the market is fearful rather than greedy.
